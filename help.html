            <summary class="font-medium text-gray-200 hover:text-sky-400">What if I withdraw to the wrong address/account?</summary>
            <div class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-400 pl-4 border-l-2 border-sky-500">
                <p><strong>It is crucial to double-check all withdrawal details (wallet addresses, bank account numbers, IFSC codes) before confirming any transaction.</strong></p>
                <p class="mt-2">Due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions and banking processes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1">
                    <li><strong>Cryptocurrency (USDT-TRC20):</strong> Transactions on the blockchain are generally irreversible. If you send USDT to an incorrect TRC20 address, it is highly unlikely that the funds can be recovered unless you know the owner of that address and they are willing to return the funds. GainX does not have control over external wallet addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bank Transfers (IMPS/NEFT):</strong> Once a bank transfer is requested, the details are submitted to our automated payment portal. This portal collaborates with our partnered financial institutions to process the transfer, aiming to ensure users receive funds that are clear and not subject to any complaints or liens. If incorrect bank account details are provided, the transaction might fail. In such cases, funds may eventually be returned to your GainX wallet, though this process can take several days or even weeks and is subject to standard banking procedures. However, if the incorrect details match an existing, valid bank account, the funds might be credited to that unintended account. <strong>Please note that once a withdrawal request has been processed through our company portals, initiating a chargeback or reversal is not possible from our end.</strong> Recovery in such scenarios is exceptionally challenging and not guaranteed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the withdrawal information you provide. GainX cannot be held liable for losses incurred due to withdrawals made to incorrect or unintended addresses/accounts provided by you.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">If you realize you have made an error, please <a href="tickets.html" class="ticket-link">create a support ticket</a> immediately with all relevant transaction details. While we cannot guarantee recovery, we will provide any guidance possible based on the situation.</p>

        <h3>Swapping Tokens</h3>

            <summary class="font-medium text-gray-200 hover:text-sky-400">How do I swap tokens (e.g., USDT to ZSG)?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-400 pl-4 border-l-2 border-sky-500">Click the "Swap Tokens" button. In the swap modal, select the token you want to swap from and the token you want to receive. Enter the amount, review the rate and approximate amount you'll receive, then confirm the swap.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mb-2 bg-gray-800 p-3 rounded-md cursor-pointer">
            <summary class="font-medium text-gray-200 hover:text-sky-400">What is the ZSG token?</summary>
            <div class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-400 pl-4 border-l-2 border-sky-500">
                <p>ZSG is a decentralized crypto token, operating as the native utility asset of the GainX platform. It is engineered to empower users and facilitate a wide range of operations and benefits within our growing ecosystem. At GainX, we are deeply committed to fostering a secure, transparent, and robust environment for all ZSG token holders and platform participants.</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Understanding ZSG - Key Aspects:</strong></p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1">
                    <li><strong>Core Utility & Purpose:</strong> ZSG serves as a key component for accessing specific services, unlocking exclusive features, and participating in unique opportunities available on the GainX platform. Further details on evolving utilities will be consistently communicated through our official channels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Acquisition Method:</strong> Currently, ZSG tokens can be conveniently acquired by swapping from USDT directly within your secure GainX Wallet. This process is designed to be seamless and user-friendly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Dynamics & Value:</strong> As with other digital assets in the decentralized space, the value of ZSG can be influenced by various market dynamics, including supply and demand, overall market sentiment, and the ongoing development and adoption of the GainX project. We encourage all users to conduct their own research and understand these inherent factors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> GainX is dedicated to maintaining a high degree of transparency regarding ZSG's tokenomics, smart contract details (where applicable), and project development milestones. All official updates, news, and critical information will be disseminated through verified GainX communication channels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">Our fundamental objective is to build sustainable, long-term value and expanding utility for the ZSG token within the GainX ecosystem. We strongly advise our users to stay updated by regularly checking our official announcements and to always exercise due diligence and responsible practices when engaging with any digital asset.</p>
